# Gift Sets Manager
The Gift Sets Manager is a project aimed at creating the gift sets with products with user interface and save them to local database.

User interface allows for combining the products into sets and saving them.

The Products table shows possible elements to combine into gift sets. Every product has its price shown immediately after selection from the list.
"Add to the set" moves the product to the "Create your set view". After composing desired set and giving it a name, the button "Create set" allows for saving it in the database.
